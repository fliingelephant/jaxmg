## TODO (last updated: January 7th, 2026)

### Small effort

- ~~**Implement multi-process variants of `potri` and `syevd`**. Right now we only have `potrs_mp.cu` which contains all the necessary machinery to also create multi-process equivalents of `potri.cu`, `syevd.cu` and `syevd_no_V.cu`.~~ (#10)

- ~~**Get rid of compiler warnings** There is some unused code that needs to be removed. There are warnings due to things in JAXlib that we probably can't get rid of though.~~ (#10)

- **Better error handling**. There are parts of the code that simply throw `std::runtime_error`. We need to make the error handling compatible with the XLA_FFI error handlers like: `FFI_ASSIGN_OR_RETURN`, `JAX_FFI_RETURN_IF_GPU_ERROR`, etc... 

### Large effort

- Change to the CusolverMp API that's available for CUDA 13.

## Build from source

To build from source:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
```

This installs the CUDA binaries into `src/jaxmg/bin`

Dependencies are managed with [CPM-CMAKE](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake),
including **abseil-cpp**, **jaxlib**, **XLA** for compilation. Compilation requires C++20 or later and an installation of CUDA Toolkit 12.x or 13.x.

To build specific targets only, for example potrs:
```bash
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target potrs && cmake --install .
```

then install the package with 

```bash
pip install .
```

To verify the installation (requires at least one GPU) run

```bash
pytest tests
```
There are two types of tests:

1. SPMD tests: Single Process Multiple GPU tests.
3. MPMD: Multiple Processes Multiple GPU tests.

Use the `conftest.py` file in tests to turn on/off any tests you want to run. 

## JAX and CUDA

As of version 0.6.2, JAX can be installed for GPU usage in two ways:

1. `pip install "jax[cuda12]"`: Install a NVIDIA python module along side the jax installation and rely on those binaries for CUDA functionality.

2. `pip install "jax[cuda12-local]"`: Rely on a local installation.

As of version 0.7.2, JAX is compatible with CUDA 13:

1. `pip install "jax[cuda13]"`:

2. `pip install "jax[cuda13-local]"`

At compilation time, we do not need to worry about the distinction between `cudax` and `cudax-local`, since the symbols we link again are resolved at runtime via `import jax`. However, 

Jaxlib contains C++ headers that have to be compiled against. To compile against a specific Jaxlib version, set the environment variable
`JAX_VERSION` before building. For CUDA 12, `JAX_VERSION=0.6.2` is backwards compatible up to `jax==0.8.x`, but for CUDA 13 you must set
`JAX_VERSION>=0.7.2` or you will get compilation errors.

## Continuous integration

We make use of Jenkins to build and test the code. We test the following configurations:

1. A manylinux docker images (quay.io/pypa/manylinux_2_28_x86_64) where we install CUDA, CUDNN and NCCL.

2. Python `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`, `3.14`

3. For CUDA 12:
   - JAX `0.6.2`, `0.7.1`, `0.8.1`

   For CUDA 13 **currently only building code but no testing due to lack of availibility of CC > 7.0 GPUs. Locally tested on Blackwell.**
   - JAX `0.7.2`, `0.8.1`

See `.jenkins/Jenkinsfile` for details

## Documentation setup

See https://olgarithms.github.io/sphinx-tutorial/docs/7-hosting-on-github-pages.html

Make sure you install `jaxmg[docs]` to be able to generate the documentation.
Run 

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

to serve the docs locally. On push to main, the docs are automatically deployed with the `.github/workflow/deploy-docs.yml` action.

## Publish Package

Get the latest built wheels from Jenkins:

```bash
mkdir dist
VERSION=0.0.4
CUDA_FLAVOR=cuda12-local
JAX_VERSION=0.8.1
for PY in 3.11 3.12 3.13 3.14; do
   PYTAG=cp${PY/./}
   URL="https://jenkins.flatironinstitute.org/job/jaxmg/job/jenkins/lastBuild/artifact/${CUDA_FLAVOR}/${PY}/${JAX_VERSION}/dist_repaired/jaxmg-${VERSION}-${PYTAG}-${PYTAG}-manylinux_2_26_x86_64.whl"
   echo "Downloading ${URL}"
   wget -q -N --show-progress "${URL}" -P ./dist
done
```
Install twine
```bash
python -m pip install twine
```
Upload to testpypi
```bash
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
Test the wheel
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ "jaxmg[cuda12]==0.0.4" --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple
```
